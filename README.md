## What WhiteDNS Does

WhiteDNS is a clean-IP discovery and proxy workflow toolkit. It expands IP ranges, scans ports, tests TLS/SNI behavior, verifies HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies, exports ASN targets, and saves results in a format that is easy to reuse in proxy and routing workflows.

### Key Features

- Native Go scanner engine with CIDR expansion, concurrency control, pause/resume, stop, progress, and result export.
- Desktop terminal UI for scanning, routing, DPI/desync-related workflows, config tools, and proxy operations.
- Android app with IP/CIDR scan, SNI scan, HTTP proxy scan, SOCKS5 scan, ASN export, foreground service scanning, and storage export.
- ASN-aware target handling using embedded datasets.
- Standalone desktop builds with embedded runtime assets.
- Android multi-ABI builds: `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86`, `x86_64`, universal APK, and release AAB.

## Desktop 1.3 Guide

### Download

Go to **Releases** and download the file for your operating system:

| OS | Asset |
|---|---|
| Windows | `whitedns-windows-amd64.exe` |
| Linux x64 | `whitedns-linux-amd64` |
| Linux ARM64 | `whitedns-linux-arm64` |
| macOS Intel | `whitedns-macos-amd64` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `whitedns-macos-arm64` |
| Termux / Android ARM64 | `whitedns-termux-arm64` |

### Run

> **Why can't I just double-click it on macOS/Linux?**
> WhiteDNS is a terminal UI (TUI) application — it draws its interface inside a
> terminal, so it has no window to open on double-click. On Windows the `.exe`
> automatically launches a console, but on macOS and Linux a bare command-line
> binary won't auto-attach a terminal (and Linux file managers block running
> downloaded binaries for security). You must run it from a terminal as shown
> below.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\whitedns-windows-amd64.exe -mode ui -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080
```

macOS (Intel: `whitedns-macos-amd64` · Apple Silicon: `whitedns-macos-arm64`):

```bash
# cd into the folder where you downloaded the binary
cd ~/Downloads

# make it executable (only needed once)
chmod +x ./whitedns-macos-arm64

# clear Apple's Gatekeeper quarantine flag on the download (only needed once)
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./whitedns-macos-arm64

# run it
./whitedns-macos-arm64 -mode ui -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080
```

If you skip the `xattr` step, macOS shows *"cannot be opened because the
developer cannot be verified."* You can also right-click the file in Finder →
**Open** → **Open** to whitelist it once.

> **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):** the released macOS binaries are **ad-hoc
> code-signed**, so they run without the `killed` error. If you ever see
> `zsh: killed` (e.g. on a binary you built yourself), apply an ad-hoc signature
> once:
> ```bash
> codesign --force --sign - ./whitedns-macos-arm64
> ```

Linux (x64: `whitedns-linux-amd64` · ARM64: `whitedns-linux-arm64`):

```bash
# cd into the folder where you downloaded the binary
cd ~/Downloads

# make it executable (only needed once)
chmod +x ./whitedns-linux-amd64

# run it
./whitedns-linux-amd64 -mode ui -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080
```

Proxy-only mode (macOS/Linux):

```bash
./whitedns-linux-amd64 -mode proxy -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080
```

> **Note:** The leading `./` is required — without it the shell only searches
> system `PATH`, not the current folder, and you'll get `command not found`.

### Desktop Notes

- Results and logs are written beside the executable in WhiteDNS output folders.
- ASN datasets and Cloudflare domain assets are embedded in the binary.
- Use the TUI for the full workflow experience.
- Use proxy mode when you only need the local proxy/tunnel behavior.

## Android 1.3.1 Guide

### Download

From **Releases**, download one of the Android artifacts:

| Artifact | Use Case |
|---|---|
| `WhiteDNS-IP-Scanner-universal-release.apk` | Recommended direct install for most users |
| `WhiteDNS-IP-Scanner-arm64-v8a-release.apk` | Most modern Android phones |
| `WhiteDNS-IP-Scanner-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` | Older 32-bit ARM devices |
| `WhiteDNS-IP-Scanner-x86-release.apk` / `x86_64` | Emulator and x86 devices |
| `WhiteDNS-IP-Scanner-release.aab` | Play Store upload |

### Install

1. Download the APK to your phone.
2. Open it from your file manager.
3. Allow installation from your browser/file manager if Android asks.
4. Open **WhiteDNS IP Scanner**.
5. Grant storage/folder access if you want the app to create and write to the public `WhiteDNS Scanner` folder.

### Android Features

- IP / CIDR Scan
- SNI Scanner
- HTTP Proxy Scan
- SOCKS5 Scan
- ASN Export
- Pause / Resume / Stop scanning
- Results, logs, and ASN exports saved under `WhiteDNS Scanner`

### Android Storage Output

When folder access is granted, WhiteDNS writes to a user-visible folder:

```text
/sdcard/WhiteDNS Scanner/
```

Fallback/app-specific location:

```text
/sdcard/Android/data/com.whitescan.app/files/WhiteDNS Scanner/
```

## Build From Source

### Requirements

- Go 1.25+
- PowerShell on Windows, or bash on Linux/macOS
- For Windows desktop icon embedding: `go install github.com/tc-hib/go-winres@latest`
- For Android: JDK 17, Android SDK API 34, NDK r26, Gradle 8.7, gomobile

### Desktop Build

Build all desktop targets:

```powershell
.\build_cross_platform.ps1 -CleanBuild
```

The Windows `.exe` build embeds the same WhiteDNS icon used by Android. The
script generates the Windows resource file automatically when `go-winres` is
available.

Run tests:

```powershell
go test ./...
```

### Android Build

Build the Go mobile AAR:

```powershell
.\build-aar.ps1
```

Build Android from the `android` folder:

```powershell
cd android
gradle assembleRelease bundleRelease
```

For complete Android build instructions, see:

```text
android/README.md
```
